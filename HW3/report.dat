Bugs/errors in wallet_stat.c

line 4: Invalid preprocessing directive #inlcude. 
	Changed it to #include instead.

line 5: In order to use functions like strcmp(), we need to include the string library.

line 6: Added #include <unistd.h> in order to call fork(),and execvp() later in the program.

line 64: It should be scanf instead of fscanf, since we are reading the filename from stdin.

line 72: Again, it should be scanf instead of fscanf, since we are reading the user's chosen command from stdin.

line 76: The 2nd argument of the function execvp() could not be null.
	It should be an array of pointers which is terminated by a NULL pointer.
	The first argument, by convention, should point to the filename associated with the file being executed. 

line 75: Declared and initialized an array in order for execvp() to work.

line 79: I used top and found that if we call sleep(), it will create a zombie process each time we choose the help command since the child process is never reaped.To avoid zombie process, we should use wait() instead.

line 7 : Included the <sys/wait.h> library to use the wait() function.

line 32 : The generate_wallets() function should take two arguments, a pointer pointing to the wallet array and the number of wallets read from the file it should generate.  
	  Otherwise it will generate 5000000 wallets no matter what, which will result in segmentation fault since we only allocate memory for num_wallets wallets.

line 44: fprintf() the format for printing both the key and money should be %u since they are uint32_t. 
	 Also,it was originally printing keys twice.

line 10: Money should be an uint32_t since money_gen() returns an uint32_t. 

line 13: In the print_help() function, I added a command information since print_help.o is only showing 2 command options and 'quit' is missing. Added print_help() on line 80.

line 111: To avoid memory leak, we need to call free() on those allocated memory blocks and fclose(file pointer) before exiting the program.

line 101: It's safer to use strcpy() when we change the filename.

line 45: Use fflush(fp) to force data to be printed on the file right away.

line 93: Added constraints on the 'print' command. If wallets are not yet generated. Their infomation could not be printed. Otherwise all the wallet's key and money will be just zero.


Bugs/errors in print_help

I used valgrind to run print_help and found that there's invalid pointer used. I believe it reads a char outside of the string length bound. It resulted in a segmentation fault.
